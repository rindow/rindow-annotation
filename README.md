Rindow Annotation Manager
=========================
Master: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/rindow/rindow-annotation.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/rindow/rindow-annotation)

The Annotation Manager Extracts annotations from source code.

The extracted annotation is saved in the cache and speeds up the extraction at the next reading.

Annotations are very useful for component configuration.
